# fonz_music_flutter

This flutter app is an admin app for the Fonz Music team. 

The primary function of this app was to read & write NFC coasters, check ownership & attributes of existing coasters, & remove owners of coasters. 

This app compiles for both iOS & Android. The NFC functions for iOS are written natively in Swift & use NFC_in_Flutter for Android apps.
